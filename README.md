# TrainSchedulerDanny

create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. 
This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.
Simply add in the specifications and your new train schedule will be stored in the firebase database.
